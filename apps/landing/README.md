## Content Strategy

The landing page tells a compelling story about:

1. **The Problem**: Traditional trucking operations are inefficient
2. **The Solution**: Dispatch streamlines everything
3. **The Benefits**: Specific improvements and ROI
4. **The Proof**: Statistics and social proof
5. **The Action**: Clear calls-to-action throughout

## Customization

- Colors can be customized in `tailwind.config.ts`
- Content can be updated in individual component files
- Styling can be modified in `globals.css`
- Animations can be adjusted in the Tailwind config

## Deployment

The landing page is ready for deployment to any platform that supports Next.js:

- Vercel (recommended)
- Netlify
- AWS Amplify
- DigitalOcean App Platform

### DigitalOcean notes

If the app is served under a subpath or via CDN, set the following env vars on the service:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH` (e.g., `/landing`)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_ASSET_PREFIX` (e.g., `https://cdn.example.com`)

The video component resolves asset URLs using these so MP4s load correctly in production. Ensure videos exist under `public/videos/` and are deployed by your platform. If a video can’t be loaded, an animated fallback is shown and the carousel advances automatically.

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with actual authentication providers
- A/B testing for different versions
- Analytics integration
- SEO optimization
- Performance monitoring
